# Framework-for-Automatic-Detection-of-Features-from-Fundus-Image
This project aims to develop a framework for the classification of Diabetic Retinopathy images based on disease criticality.

**Abstract**

Diabetic retinopathy is a major cause of vision loss and progressive blindness in the elderly and middle-aged. Currently, the resulting fundus images are manually graded by Ophthalmologists who are already overwhelmed and their numbers are decreasing. Early detection improves healing chances or helps stop or slow down its progress. The primary symptom of Diabetic Retinopathy is the exudates. Early recognition of exudates, optic disc, and Microaneurysm can reduce the chance of blindness. Our aim is to design a prototype that takes the raw fundus data from the client and pre-processes the images using image processing algorithms and processing the images followed by classification of processed images. Detection and identification of features or lesions using some algorithms.

**Objectives**
The Objective of our project is:
• To develop a GUI for the classification of Diabetic retinal Images.
• To pre-process all the raw retinal images from the dataset.
• To extract the features from pre-processed images.
